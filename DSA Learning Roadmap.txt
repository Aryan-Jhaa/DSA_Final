DSA Learning Roadmap

Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-8)
- *Learn a Language*: Master Python/Java basics (syntax, loops, functions)
- *Big-O Notation*: Understand time/space complexity (O(1), O(n), O(nÂ²))
- *Arrays & Strings*: Learn traversal, slicing, and basic operations
- *HashMaps/Dicts*: Practice frequency counting and lookups
- *Simple Sorting*: Implement Bubble Sort, then learn Merge/Quick Sort
- *Binary Search*: Master the template for sorted arrays
- *Recursion*: Solve factorial, Fibonacci, and simple tree problems
- *Basic LeetCode Easies*: Start with top-voted "Easy" problems (e.g., Two Sum)

Phase 2: Core DSA (Months 2-4)
- *Linked Lists*: Implement insertion/deletion, reverse a list
- *Stacks & Queues*: Use for problems like Valid Parentheses
- *Sliding Window*: Solve subarray/string problems (e.g., Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters)
- *Two Pointers*: Master for sorted array problems (e.g., Remove Duplicates)
- *Binary Trees*: Learn DFS (pre/in/post-order) and BFS
- *Graph Basics*: Understand adjacency lists, DFS/BFS traversals
- *Backtracking*: Try subsets/permutations problems
- *50+ LeetCode Mediums*: Focus on Arrays, Strings, and Trees

Phase 3: Patterns & Practice (Months 5-8)
- *Divide & Conquer*: Solve problems like Merge K Sorted Lists
- *Heap/Priority Queue*: Learn for top-K elements (e.g., K Closest Points)
- *Tries*: Practice word problems (e.g., Word Search)
- *Union-Find*: Tackle connectivity problems
- *Dynamic Programming*: Start with 1D problems (Climbing Stairs)
- *Memoization*: Cache results in DP problems
- *Graph Algorithms*: Dijkstra's (shortest path), Topological Sort
- *System Design Basics*: Design TinyURL or a cache

Phase 4: Mastery (Months 9-12)
- *Advanced Problems*: Attempt 10-20 LeetCode Hards (e.g., Merge K Sorted Lists)
- *Mock Interviews*: Use Pramp/LeetCode Interview Simulator weekly
- *Revisit Weak Areas*: Focus on 2-3 problem types you struggle with
- *Competitive Coding*: Join LeetCode contests (optional)
- *Behavioral Prep*: Practice STAR method for interviews
- *Final Review*: Re-solve 50 high-frequency problems (e.g., NeetCode 150)

Key Principles
- *Daily Practice*: 2-3 hours/day (1-2 problems + review)
- *Active Learning*: Spend 20-30 minutes trying a problem before checking solutions
- *Spaced Repetition*: Revisit old problems weekly
- *Patterns > Memorization*: Focus on recognizing problem types

Target
- *6 Months*: ~300 problems (focus on Easy/Medium)
- *12 Months*: ~500 problems (include Hards)

By following this roadmap, you can develop a strong foundation in DSA and improve your problem-solving skills. Adjust the pace based on your progress and needs.
